I was really disappointed with my stay at this hotel. The room was not clean when I arrived, and there was a strong musty smell in the air. The staff seemed uninterested in helping, and when I asked for assistance with my issues, I was met with rude responses. The facilities were outdated, and the amenities promised on the website were nowhere to be found. I expected much better for the price I paid, and I will not be returning.
